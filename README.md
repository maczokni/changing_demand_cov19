# Understanding Changing Demand for Police During the Coronavirus Pandemic

This repository contains the code and data processing scripts for the paper  
**_Understanding Changing Demand for Police During the Coronavirus Pandemic_**.

## Overview

This study investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic affected police demand in England, focusing on:

- Changes in call volumes and types  
- Spatial and socio-demographic patterns of calls  
- Call handler experiences during the pandemic

A mixed-methods approach combines time series and spatial analysis of calls for service (2015–2020) with qualitative interview data.

- `.Rproj`: R Project file to manage the working environment  
- `data/`: *(Not included)* Expected structure described in scripts  
- `outputs/`: *(Optional)* Directory to save results and figures  

## Key Methods

- Time series forecasting to estimate counterfactual demand  
- Gini coefficient and Location Quotient for spatial concentration  
- Linkage with Index of Multiple Deprivation for socio-demographic context  

## Requirements

- R (≥ 4.0)  
- Relevant R packages (see `scripts/` for library calls)
